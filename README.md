# Description

Reality XP's XP 12 Enhancer aims to address the dark cockpits issue that many X-Plane 12 users have experienced.

The original version can be found [here](https://x-plane.to/).

I have modified this, as the original author may be too busy or no longer interested in supporting this, to resolve the issues surrounding X-Plane 12.1.0 whereby several datarefs no longer exist thus causing the script to be quarantined by FlyWithLua.

Note that although the X-Plane.to website states that modification and distribution are not allowed, the script itself (v1.9.5) is licensed under the MIT license as per the file header contained within the v1.9.5 download on X-Plane.to. This edit is based on v1.9.5 therefore I am free to modify and distribute this edit as long as I retain the copyright and license as I have done.

My aim is not to take credit for CptLucky's wonderful script, it's only to address the outstanding issue. If CptLucky makes a return and fixes the script then I will archive this repository.
